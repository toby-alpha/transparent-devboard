### Why I designed this?

I was really intrigued with the concept of a transparent PCB, after seeing a JLCPCB advertisement for it. This prompted me to create an ESP devboard, that would be useful in many scenarios, while also exploring this new technology. The PCB also serves as a great method of education, showing inside of the complex electronics.
