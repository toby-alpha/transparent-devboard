# ESP32-C3 Based (not so) Transparent Dev Board

* unforchantly due to manufacturing constraints, the transparent board has to come to an end.. (it was 300USD for 20 transparents). I'll look for ways to produce it after this, and probably persue it as a personal endeavor.*

The Dev Board is based off the ESP32 C3 Mini module. It contains a USB-C port, power LED, user LED, 3x WS2812B 2020 Adressable LEDs, >6V voltage input, as well as all GPIO being broken out. The USB-C connector is inline to conform to a slim profile. It also has a JST SH connector for i2C connections.

It's specially manufactured from a transparent FR4 material to give it's unique look.

## Why I designed this?

I was really intrigued with the concept of a transparent PCB, after seeing a JLCPCB advertisement for it. This prompted me to create an ESP devboard, that would be useful in many scenarios, while also exploring this new technology. The PCB also serves as a great method of education, showing inside of the complex electronics.
